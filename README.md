The **Signer** class is designed for those who are signing data on behalf of a public-private keypair.

This is a thin wrapper around the [skyzyx/signer](https://github.com/skyzyx/signer) package.

This project uses [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org) for managing backwards-compatibility.

* [API Reference](https://wepay.github.io/signer-ruby/)

## Installation

```ruby
composer require wepay/signer:^1.0
```


## Testing

Firstly, run `make install` to download and install the dependencies.

You can run the tests as follows:

```bash
make test
```


## API Reference

The API Reference is generated by a tool called [Sami](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/Sami). Once it's installed, you 
can generate updated documentation by running the following command in the root of the repository.

```bash
make docs
```


## Deploying
The `Makefile` (yes, `Makefile`) has a series of commands to simplify the development and deployment process.

### `make`

Running `make` by itself will show you a list of available sub-commands.

```bash
$ make
all
docs
install
pushdocs
tag
test
version
```

### `make pushdocs`
You will need to have write-access to the `wepay/signer-php` repository on GitHub. You should have already set up:

* Your SSH key with your GitHub account.
* Had your GitHub user given write-access to the repository.

Then you can run:

```bash
make pushdocs
```

You can view your changes at <https://wepay.github.io/signer-php/>.

### `make version`
This allows you to set the version number for the next release.

### `make tag`
You will need to have a [Keybase](https://keybase.io) account first, including setting-up the
[`keybase` CLI tool](https://keybase.io/docs/command_line/prerequisites).

Then you can run:

```bash
make tag
```

You can view your changes in the `SIGNED.md` file.
