This is a thin wrapper around the [skyzyx/signer](https://github.com/skyzyx/signer) package.

This project uses [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org) for managing backwards-compatibility.


## Examples
### Generate a signature
```php
use WePay\Signer\Signer;

$client_id = 'your_client_id';
$client_secret = 'your_client_secret';

$signer = new Signer($client_id, $client_secret);
$signature = $signer->sign([
    'token'        => $your_token,
    'page'         => $wepay_page_to_visit,
    'redirect_uri' => $partner_page_to_return_to,
]);

$signature = wordwrap($signature, 64, "\n", true);
#=> dfbffab5b6f7156402da8147886bba3eba67bd5baf2e780ba9d39e8437db7c47
#=> 35e9a0b834aa21ac76f98da8c52a2a0cd1b0192d0f0df5c98e3848b1b2e1a037
```

### Generate all of the query string parameters for the request
```php
$querystring = $signer->generateQueryStringParams([
    'token'        => $your_token,
    'page'         => $wepay_page_to_visit,
    'redirect_uri' => $partner_page_to_return_to,
]);

#=> client_id=your_client_id&
#=> page=https://wepay.com/account/12345&
#=> redirect_uri=https://partnersite.com/home&
#=> token=dfbffab5b6f7156402da8147886bba3eba67bd5baf2e780ba9d39e8437db7c47...
```


## Installation

Using [Composer]:
```bash
composer require wepay/signer-php=^1.0
```

And include it in your scripts:

```php
require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';
```


## Testing

Firstly, run `composer install --optimize-autoloader` to download and install the dependencies.

You can run the tests as follows:
```bash
bin/phpunit
```


## API Reference

The API Reference is generated by a tool called [Sami](http://phpdoc.org). You should install it locally
on your system with:

Once it's installed, you can generate updated documentation by running the following command in the root of the
repository.
```bash
bin/sami.php update docs/sami-config.php -v
```


## GPG Signing

Each release (i.e., git tag) is GPG-signed. You can easily verify the contents using [Keybase](https://keybase.io).

```bash
keybase dir verify
```

If you're more familiar with traditional GPG signing, view `SIGNED.md` for the information you need to do the verification.

## Coding Standards

PSR-0/1/2 are a solid foundation, but are not an entire coding style by themselves. I have taken the time to document all of the nitpicky patterns and nuances of my personal coding style. It goes well-beyond brace placement and tabs vs. spaces to cover topics such as docblock annotations, ternary operations and which variation of English to use. It aims for thoroughness and pedanticism over hoping that we can all get along.
