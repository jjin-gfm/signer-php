Coding Standards
================

PSR-0/1/2 are a solid foundation, but are not an entire coding style by
themselves. I have taken the time to document all of the nitpicky
patterns and nuances of my personal coding style. It goes well-beyond
brace placement and tabs vs. spaces to cover topics such as docblock
annotations, ternary operations and which variation of English to use.
It aims for thoroughness and pedanticism over hoping that we can all get
along.
